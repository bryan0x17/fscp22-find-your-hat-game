# Find Your Hat

## Summary:

A simple command line game where you try to find your hat in a field. Guide your character to your hat without falling in hole.

You can run the program as follows:

```
node main.js <length> <width> <difficulty> [hard]
```

where length, width, and difficulty are positive integers. Length and width determine the size of the field in characters, while difficulty is a percentage that determines how much of the field will be holes. 
By adding 'hard' as the last argument, the game will be played in hard mode: every turn, one field square will turn into a hole.
